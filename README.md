# CloudSync Landing

Marketing + blueprint case study showing how I approach site architecture, system tokens, and developer handoff.

## Highlights
- `/` presents the full marketing narrative with metrics, testimonials, and purpose-built CTAs.
- `/blueprint` mirrors the annotated Figma file with sitemap, responsive grids, and motion specs for engineers.
- `/docs` contains `design-system.md` and `architecture.md`, documenting tokens, spacing, and flow decisions.

## Craft & Handoff
- Accessibility fundamentals: skip link, semantic landmarks, visible focus states, and high-contrast palette.
- Micro-interactions (card lift, CTA shadows) are described in the blueprint route for consistent implementation.
- Design file: [CloudSync Landing Blueprint](https://www.figma.com/file/gamemaker-cloudsync/CloudSync-Landing-Blueprint?type=design).

Deploy as a standard Next.js app on Vercel (`next build` / `.next`). Share the live URL alongside the blueprint and docs so reviewers see both the polish and the process.
