## User Journey
1. Hero clarifies positioning and invites recruiters to view the blueprint.

3. Process timeline walks through discovery → polish.
4. Blueprint route reveals technical depth and supports developer collaboration.

## Wireframe Notes

- Buttons stay consistent between marketing and blueprint routes for continuity.
